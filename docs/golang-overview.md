# Go (Golang) Overview

This overview serves as a central hub for learning the Go programming language, covering everything from fundamental syntax to high-performance concurrency patterns.

## 🟢 Beginner: The Fundamentals
- **[Go Basics](golang-basics.md)**: Variables, constants, data types, and control flow.
- **[Data Structures](golang-data-structures.md)**: Working with Arrays, Slices, and Maps.
- **[Functions & Packages](golang-functions.md)**: Organizing code and understanding scope.

## 🟡 Intermediate: Building Logic
- **[Structs & Methods](golang-structs.md)**: Object-oriented-like patterns in Go.
- **[Interfaces & Abstraction](golang-interfaces.md)**: Implicit interfaces and polymorphic behavior.
- **[Error Handling](golang-error-handling.md)**: The "Go way" of managing exceptions.

## 🔴 Advanced: Performance & Scalability
- **[Concurrency Patterns](golang-concurrency.md)**: Goroutines, Channels, and Select.
- **[Pointers & Memory](golang-pointers.md)**: Understanding references and heap vs stack.
- **[Reflect & Generic](golang-generics.md)**: Modern Go features for reusable code.

## 🏗️ Production & Ecosystem
- **[Go Best Practices](golang-best-practices.md)**: Clean code and effective Go patterns.
- **[Testing in Go](golang-testing.md)**: Unit tests, benchmarks, and table-driven tests.
- **[Golang Microservices](golang-microservices.md)**: Building scalable backend services.
