# Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.

## Core Concepts
- **Readability**: Python's syntax is designed to be clear and concise.
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line by line.
- **Dynamically Typed**: Variable types are determined at runtime.
- **Large Standard Library**: Includes modules for everything from web development to data science.

## Basic Syntax
```python
# Printing to the console
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables and Data Types
name = "Wiki"
age = 25
is_active = True

# Control Structures
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")

# Functions
def greet(person):
    return f"Hello, {person}!"

print(greet(name))
```

## Popular Frameworks
- **Web**: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
