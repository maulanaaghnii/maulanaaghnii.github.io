# Docker Volumes

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

## Why use Volumes?
- Data persists even if the container is deleted.
- Easier to back up or migrate.
- Shared data between containers.

## Types of Mounts
1. **Volumes**: Managed by Docker (best way).
2. **Bind Mounts**: Maps a specific path on the host to the container.
3. **tmpfs Mounts**: Stored in host memory (never written to disk).

## Commands
```bash
# Create a volume
docker volume create my-data

# List volumes
docker volume ls

# Run container with volume
docker run -d --name my-app -v my-data:/app/data my-image

# Remove volume
docker volume rm my-data
```
